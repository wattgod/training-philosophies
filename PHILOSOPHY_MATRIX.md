## The 13 Methodologies

### 1. Polarized Training (POL)

**Selection Triggers:**
- VO2max limiter
- History of overtraining on sweet spot
- Needs mental freshness
- Racing requires surges/attacks

**Zone Distribution:** 80% Z1-Z2 / 0% Z3 / 20% Z4-Z5

---

### 2. G-Spot Training (Gravel God G-Spot)

**Concept:** Maximize adaptations per unit time at 84-97% FTP. The Gravel God branded approach to sweet spot.

### 4. High-Volume Low-Intensity (HVLI/LSD)

**Concept:** Old-school aerobic base building. Long, slow miles.

**Best For:**
- 15+ hours/week available
- Beginners building foundation

- Recovery from burnout

**Selection Triggers:**
- No structured training history
- Aerobic deficiency syndrome
- Coming off injury
- Reset after overtraining

**Zone Distribution:** 95% Z1-Z2 / 5% Z3

---

### 5. Threshold Training (THR)

**Concept:** Focus on sustainable power at or near FTP.

**Best For:**

**Selection Triggers:**
- FTP plateau
- Specific TT preparation
- Breakaway specialists
- Responds well to threshold work

**Zone Distribution:** 65% Z1-Z2 / 10% Z3 / 20% Z4 / 5% Z5

**Signature Workout:** 2x20 @ 95-100% FTP

---

### 6. VO2max/HIIT-Focused

**Concept:** Short, intense intervals to maximize oxygen uptake.

**Best For:**
- 5-8 hours/week
- VO2max-limited athletes
- Short, punchy events (<3 hours)
- Masters athletes losing top end

**Selection Triggers:**
- Declining 5-min power
- Criterium/road race focus
- Responds to intensity
- Limited training time

**Zone Distribution:** 70% Z1-Z2 / 5% Z3 / 5% Z4 / 20% Z5

**Signature Workout:** Billats: 30/30s @ 115-120% FTP

---

### 7. Block Periodization

**Concept:** Concentrated loading of one energy system for 2-3 weeks, then switch.

**Best For:**
- Advanced cyclists only
- Athletes needing breakthrough
- Pre-peak phase
- Those who plateau on mixed training

**Selection Triggers:**
- Training age 5+ years
- Specific limiters identified
- 6+ weeks to event
- Can handle concentrated stress

**Cycle:** Endurance Block → Threshold Block → VO2max Block → Taper

---

### 8. Reverse Periodization

**Concept:** Start with intensity, add volume as event approaches.

**Best For:**
- Spring events (after winter base)
- Indoor training → outdoor transition
- Athletes who lose fitness quickly
- Those who build endurance easily

**Selection Triggers:**
- Winter/indoor training phase
- Short base-building window
- High natural endurance
- Maintains FTP with little work

---

### 9. MAF Method (Maffetone)

**Concept:** Train at 180-age HR cap. Pure aerobic development.

**Best For:**
- Beginners
- Recovery from overtraining
- Ultra-endurance
- Health-focused athletes

**Selection Triggers:**
- History of overtraining
- High resting HR
- Aerobic deficiency (high VI)
- Patience for long-term build

**HR Cap:** 180 - age (+5 if 2+ years training, -5 if returning from break)

---

### 10. Norwegian Method

**Concept:** High-frequency threshold intervals with controlled lactate.

**Best For:**
- Elite/near-elite athletes
- 15+ hours available
- Threshold-limited
- Athletes with lactate testing

**Selection Triggers:**
- Training age 7+ years
- Access to lactate analyzer
- Can train 2x/day
- Specific threshold focus

**Key Feature:** 4x8-10min @ ~4mmol lactate, 3-4x per week

---

### 11. Time-Crunched Training

**Concept:** Maximum efficiency for minimal time investment.

**Best For:**
- <6 hours/week
- Busy professionals
- Maintenance phases
- "Minimum effective dose"

**Selection Triggers:**
- Work/life constraints
- Accepting performance plateau
- Consistency > optimization
- Indoor training primary

**Structure:** 3-4 sessions/week, all structured

---

### 12. Autoregulated/RPE-Based

**Concept:** Adjust intensity based on daily readiness rather than fixed zones.

**Best For:**
- Variable schedules
- High life stress
- Masters athletes
- Those who overtrain on rigid plans

**Selection Triggers:**
- HRV variability is high
- Inconsistent sleep
- Travel-heavy schedule
- Feels "off" on planned hard days

**Key Tool:** Daily readiness assessment, flexible intensity

---

### 13. Concurrent/Mixed

**Concept:** Blend of all energy systems in every week.

**Best For:**

- General fitness goals
- Off-season maintenance
- Multi-sport athletes

**Selection Triggers:**
- No specific limiter
- 6-10 hours available
- Variety-seeking personality
- Unclear event demands
