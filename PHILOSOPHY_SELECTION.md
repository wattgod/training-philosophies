# Philosophy Selection Heuristics

## Quick Decision Framework

When an athlete asks "what training approach should I use?" — follow this flowchart.

---

## Step 1: Rule Out Red Flags

Before recommending any intensity-based philosophy:

**If YES to any of these → Start with MAF or HVLI:**
- [ ] Coming back from injury (last 6 months)
- [ ] Shows overtraining markers (elevated resting HR, poor sleep, declining performance)
- [ ] Training age < 1 year structured
- [ ] Aerobic deficiency (Decoupling > 10% on 2-hour Z2 rides)
- [ ] Explicitly requested "reset" or "rebuild"

## Step 2: Time Budget Reality Check

**Ask:** "How many hours can you *consistently* train per week for the next 12 weeks?"

| Their Answer | Realistic Expectation | Philosophy Options |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| "I can do 15+ hours" | Verify: they rarely can | Traditional, Norwegian (if truly available) |
| "10-12 hours" | Most serious amateurs | Polarized, Traditional |
| "8-10 hours" | Sweet spot for most | Polarized, G-Spot |
| "6-8 hours" | Common reality | G-Spot, Time-Crunched |
| "Under 6 hours" | Accept limitations | Time-Crunched only |

**Gravel God Principle:** People overestimate available time by 20-30%. Subtract accordingly.

## Step 3: Identify Primary Limiter

**Data sources:**
- Power profile analysis (5s, 1min, 5min, 20min, 60min)
- MMP curve shape
- Race performance analysis
- Athlete self-report

| Limiter Pattern | Evidence | Target Philosophy |
|-----------------|----------|------------------|
| FTP limited | Flat 20-60min curve, poor IF sustainability | G-Spot → Threshold |
| VO2max limited | Sharp drop-off 3-8 min, can't respond to attacks | Polarized, HIIT |
| Durability limited | Great 20min, collapses at 3+ hours | Traditional, HVLI |
| Anaerobic limited | Strong endurance, no sprint/punch | Block (anaerobic focus) |
| No clear limiter | Proportional profile | Concurrent, then specialize |

---

## Step 4: Event-Specific Matching

| Event Type | Duration | Key Demands | Philosophy Match |
|------------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Gravel 50-80 miles | 3-5 hrs | Sustained + punches | Polarized, G-Spot |
| Gravel 100-150 miles | 5-10 hrs | Durability + pacing | Traditional, Polarized |
| Gravel 200+ miles | 10+ hrs | Survival, fat ox | HVLI, MAF, Traditional |
| Time Trial | 30-60 min | Pure threshold | Threshold |
| Criterium | 30-60 min | VO2max + sprint | HIIT |
| Stage Race | Multi-day | Recovery + repeatability | Polarized |
| Gran Fondo | 4-8 hrs | Endurance + social | Concurrent |

---

## Step 5: Personality Fit

The best philosophy is the one they'll actually follow.

| Athlete Type | Likely Preference | Avoid |
|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| Type-A, data-driven | G-Spot, Block | MAF (too unstructured) |
| Enjoys suffering | Threshold, HIIT | HVLI (too easy) |
| Volume junkie | Traditional, HVLI | Time-Crunched |
| Hates indoor | Polarized, Traditional | HIIT (often indoors) |
| Needs variety | Concurrent, Polarized | Block (monotonous) |
| Overthinks | Autoregulated, MAF | Complex periodization |

## Decision Examples

### Example 1: The Time-Crunched Professional

**Profile:**
- 45 years old
- 6-8 hours/week max
- Targeting Unbound 200
- 3 years structured training
- FTP: 240W, good 5-min power

**Analysis:**
- Hours: Limited → G-Spot or Time-Crunched
- Experience: Intermediate → Can handle intensity
- Event: Ultra-duration → Needs durability
- Limiter: Durability (short rides don't reveal this)

**Recommendation:** G-Spot base with long Z2 weekends

**Rationale:** "You can't out-intensity an ultra. Use G-Spot for weekday efficiency, but protect Saturday for 4+ hour Z2 rides. That's where Unbound fitness is built."

---

### Example 2: The Burned-Out Masters Racer

**Profile:**
- 52 years old
- 12 hours/week available
- Multiple B-races, no clear A-race
- 15 years racing
- Declining 5-min power, elevated resting HR

**Analysis:**
- Hours: Plenty
- Experience: Very high
- Signs: Overtraining, declining top-end

**Recommendation:** MAF method for 8 weeks, then reassess

**Rationale:** "Your engine needs a rebuild, not more intensity. Eight weeks of MAF will feel like going backward, but your HR will tell the story. When aerobic decoupling is under 5% at 3 hours, we add intensity back."

---

### Example 3: The Beginner With Ambition

**Profile:**
- 28 years old
- 10 hours/week available
- First gravel race (Unbound 100)
- Former runner, 1 year cycling
- No power data yet

**Analysis:**
- Hours: Good
- Experience: Minimal cycling-specific
- Event: Challenging first goal
- Limiter: Unknown (need data)

**Recommendation:** Concurrent/mixed for first 12 weeks, then specialize

**Rationale:** "You're not ready for periodization — you're ready for consistency. Ride a lot, do some intervals, learn your body. After 3 months of data, we'll know your limiter and can get specific."

---

## Red Lines (Never Do)

1. **Never prescribe Block periodization to beginners** — they lack the base to recover
2. **Never prescribe Norwegian to non-elites** — lactate testing required, high risk
3. **Never prescribe HIIT-only to ultra athletes** — wrong energy system
4. **Never prescribe 15+ hour/week plans to 6-hour athletes** — breeds failure
5. **Never ignore overtraining signs to "push through"** — MAF/rest is medicine

## When to Switch Philosophies

| Signal | Current | Switch To |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| FTP plateau > 8 weeks | G-Spot | Threshold or Polarized |
| Declining 5-min power | Any | Add VO2max work |
| Burnout symptoms | Any intensity-based | MAF or Concurrent |
| CTL > 80, race in 6 weeks | Base building | Block or peak-specific |
| Life stress spike | Rigid plan | Autoregulated |
| Event < 2 weeks | Any | Taper protocol |
